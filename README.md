# My_Vertocity_Projects
To achieve my goal which is to be a Data Scientist, I joined a teaching and placement company known as "Vertocity" and took a course on Data Science.  
In this course I leaned about differnt types of tools like Excel, Sql, Power BI, Python and ML. 
After completing one tool I need to do a project on that particlar tool and sharit with my mentors.
In this I learned so many things.
This is my first time using Github and wanted to share my Capstone Projects here.
